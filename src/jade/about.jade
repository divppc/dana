          I’m Amid, a project manager and growth expert based in Montreal, covering a wide array of web, creative, marketing and advertising services. My passion for entrepreneurship kicked off early at a young age. I started my first business, a foodservice distribution company, when I was 18. I packed it all in and moved to China in 2007, started a cellphone refurbishing business, worked in retail, wholesale, warehousing, logistics and ecommerce. I made the jump into freelance project management by accident back in 2013 and never looked back. My real life experiences combined with my efforts and that drive to help others grow helped me develop into the knowledgable man I am today.

                I’m a freelance client first who’s been there and done that. As opposed to freelance marketplaces, I don’t just connect freelance clients with freelance talent and leave everyone hanging. I do what I do  for long run and repeat business. And I strive to find dedicated freelancers with proven skills, deliver high value work and create experiences that benefit everyone I work with.
